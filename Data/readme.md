## Files & Folders

### `chen_significant_proteins` & `munro_significant_proteins`
Significant proteins found in each dataset, respectively.

Use these to:
- Compare overlap/discordance between studies
- Run pathway/GO enrichment
- Build protein-level summary figures

> **Tip:** Include columns like effect size, FDR/p-value, and gene/protein IDs if not already present.

---

### `predictions.csv`
Peptide-binding predictions generated by **MHCflurry**.

Use this file to:
- Sort peptides by predicted binding score/affinity
- Filter by allele, length, or threshold
- Select candidates for downstream validation

---

### `strong_peptides.csv`
A filtered subset of **high-confidence** peptide predictions.

Use this as your **shortlist** for:
- Experimental follow-up
- IEDB matching
- Figure-ready tables

> **Tip:** Document the exact filtering criteria (e.g., rank/affinity cutoffs) in your Methods.

---

### `iedb_matches_clean`
Cleaned matches from aligning your predicted peptides to entries in the **IEDB** database.

Use this to:
- Report prior evidence/support for candidate peptides
- Annotate peptides with epitope/assay metadata
- Prioritize peptides with external validation
