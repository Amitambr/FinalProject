# FinalProject

This script performs TMT-based proteomics analysis using the MSstatsTMT package. It manually converts FragPipe protein.tsv files into the MSstatsTMT format, applies normalization, and runs group comparisons across biological conditions. Significant proteins are identified based on log2FC and p-value thresholds, and visualized using volcano plots. The output includes annotation files, converted data, statistical results, and lists of differentially abundant proteins.
